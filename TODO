TODO

* Convert to gem

  savon-spec doesn't support mocks for raw XML requests.
* Write patch for savon-spec library to handle mocks for objects that build
  their own XML, or get rid of savon altogether.
* Finish/improve documentation
* Add more examples
* Improve test coverage
* Improve traversal efficiency
